# Phase 2 Project my three favorite animes and their top 5 characters

<!-- 
a component for each anime
a componet displaying their characters
a app component that holds the home component
a form component that lets you add characters to the anime character list(the form will be called in the individual anime components and needs to pass the form infor as a new variable that's state will be held in that anime component and then will be passed down to the fetch("PATCH") request )
a navbar component 
a home component will show both al and nl teams 
(we can add a feature to post a comment and delete a comment about the character each character has their own card and we can add comments to them and delete the comments
might not do this as its doing too much
)
